Overview
We created a CodePipeline using Terraform to deploy a simple "Hello World" Node.js application to AWS Lambda, which will be triggered by an API Gateway HTTP request.

Prerequisites
Before running the Terraform script, make sure you have the following:

AWS account with sufficient permissions
Terraform installed
Node.js installed
Git installed
Steps
Create a new Node.js project with the following files:
index.js: Lambda function code
package.json: Node.js project metadata file
package-lock.json: Dependency lock file
Initialize a new Git repository and push the project to GitHub.
Create an S3 bucket to store the deployment artifacts.
Write a Terraform script to create the following resources:
Lambda function
API Gateway REST API
API Gateway resource and method
Lambda function deployment package in S3
CodePipeline to automate the deployment process
IAM roles and policies for CodePipeline and Lambda function
Run terraform init to initialize the Terraform working directory.
Run terraform plan to preview the infrastructure changes that will be made.
Run terraform apply to apply the changes and create the resources.
Test the API endpoint by sending an HTTP request to the API Gateway REST API URL.
Conclusion
We have successfully created a simple "Hello World" Node.js application and deployed it to AWS Lambda using Terraform and CodePipeline. This serves as a starting point for more complex serverless applications that can be built and deployed using similar methods.
